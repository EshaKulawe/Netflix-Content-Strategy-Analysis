# Netflix-Content-Strategy-Analysis
Netflix's content strategy is based on creating exclusive, original content that appeals to a wide audience. In this project, we analyze the data to find viewership and release patterns based on various attributes like content type, release season, language, and release day.

### Tools
- Python: Used to clean the data and exploratory data analysis
- Google Colab: Used to run the python code

### EDA
- Viewership Hours by Content Type: This implies that people prefer shows more than movies on Netlfix 2023 as they allow viewers to engage with a longer, more immersive narrative and provide more time for in-depth 
  character development, which can foster a stronger emotional connection to the story. \

- Viewership Hours by Language: Most viewers prefer English language content, followed by other languages like Korean. This data underlines Netflix's role as a global content provider, where English remains the 
  dominant language but non-English content contributes significantly to audience engagement and cultural diversity.\

- Viewership Hours by Month: The viewership hours increase drastically in December. It might be because December includes major holidays like Christmas and New Year's, during which people tend to have more free 
  time to relax, have family gatherings, and watch content at home. Netflix experiences spikes in audience engagement in June and December, while the months from Jan to May have steady but lower viewership patterns.
  July month has the lowest viewership. The reason might be that in many countries July is a part of summer season and viewers might prefer outdoor activities or travelling to different places.\

- Monthly Release and Viewership Hours: Although the number of releases is fairly constant throughout the year, the number of viewing hours rises somewhat in June and sharply in December. This suggests that 
  viewership is impacted by the timing and popularity of particular content throughout these months rather than just the quantity of releases.\

- Weekly Releases and Viewership Hours: Maximum content release happens on Friday, with viewership hours also peaking significantly on that day. This suggests that Netflix strategically releases content toward 
  the weekend to maximize audience engagement.\
